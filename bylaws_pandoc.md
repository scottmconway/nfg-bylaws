Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcomed sexual advances to include sexual favors, quid pro quo, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, or creating a hostile environment. Examples of these include a) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s participation when b) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for decisions affecting such individual, or c) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment.
